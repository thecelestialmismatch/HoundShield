# Hound Shield — Task Queue

> **Compass-corrected 2026-06-23.** Mission = FIRST REVENUE. Stage 1 milestone by **June 25**:
> ≥3 paid **$499 CMMC AI Risk Assessment Reports** + ≥1 **RPO/MSP signed referral agreement**.
> Lead with the $499 one-time PDF, NOT a subscription. RPOs/MSPs are the channel — NOT C3PAOs.
> Sprints below (Sprint 1–4, C3PAO-channel framing) predate this correction — kept for history only.

## Stage 1 — by 2026-06-25 (THE milestone)

**Gate:** ≥3 paid $499 reports · ≥1 RPO agreement · Docker image published · Brain AI CUI warning live · one pricing page · `/security` live.

- [x] **$499 "CMMC AI Risk Assessment Report" Stripe SKU** — `POST /api/stripe/report-checkout`
  (one-time `mode:'payment'`, no-auth, inline-$499 fallback, $299 wholesale gated on `partner_ref`);
  webhook fulfillment → `report_orders` (migration 014) + `reportOrderEmail`; `/report/thank-you` page.
- [x] **Pricing page = one grid, $499 report as the hero** — report hero card on top, subscriptions
  reframed as Stage-2 monitoring; removed fabricated "2M+ / 500+" metrics.
- [x] **Mode-B / Vercel boundary disclosure everywhere** — reusable `<ModeBNotice />` on
  /pricing, /security, /partners, /report/thank-you.
- [x] **Brain AI CUI warning live** — persistent disclosure above the GlobalChat input; system
  prompt corrected to lead with the $499 report + three deployment modes.
- [x] **Publish Docker image** — `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` builds `proxy/Dockerfile`
  on every proxy PR; publishes `houndshield/proxy:latest` on a `proxy-v*` tag (needs Docker Hub secrets).
- [x] **/partners → RPO/MSP referral** — rewritten off C3PAO-endorsement framing onto $499 report
  co-brand ($299 wholesale / 40% referral) + explicit C3PAO-exclusion note; NavV3 item updated.
- [x] **RPO outreach list** — `docs/gtm/rpo-outreach-list.md` (7 named targets + frame + tracking).
- [ ] **HIPAA-first direct outreach** (Rachel) — parallel track (GTM execution, not code).
- [ ] **Close ≥3 paid reports + ≥1 RPO agreement** — the actual revenue milestone (sales execution).

> Shipped under `claude/houndshield-revenue-roadmap-m3de37`. See `compliance-firewall-agent/docs/STAGE-1-EXECUTION.md`.
> Build green · tsc clean · 539/539 tests. Remaining Stage-1 items are GTM/sales + ops config (env vars, migration push, Docker Hub secrets).

## Active — Customer status intelligence + consent-gated Brain AI (2026-07-05, branch claude/do-everything-ooda-1ijxav)

Founder ask: update site info through July 2026, make Brain AI customer-aware
(where they stand, next step, what's wrong, how to fix), keep it safe (no
cross-customer leaks), legal, and permission-gated. Shipped end-to-end:

- [x] **`lib/customer/status.ts`** — pure engine: `buildCustomerStatus()` (stage,
  standing, single next step, gaps + fixes) + `buildStatusAnswer()` (deterministic
  Brain AI answer). 12 tests, every stage branch.
- [x] **`lib/customer/client-status.ts`** — computes the SPRS slice from localStorage
  (assessment data never leaves the browser); merged with the account slice.
- [x] **Consent model** — migration 022 adds `profiles.brain_ai_data_consent`
  (default false, revocable) + `brain_ai_consent_updated_at`. `GET/POST /api/brain/consent`
  (own-row via RLS). 8 tests.
- [x] **`GET /api/customer/status`** — account-level status, own-data (RLS). 4 tests.
- [x] **Brain AI status handler** — `/api/chat` step 1c: consent-gated, own-data,
  deterministic answer BEFORE FAQ/LLM (no customer data ever reaches OpenRouter).
  Asks permission when consent is off. `lib/brain-ai/status-intent.ts`, 9 tests.
- [x] **`<CustomerStatusPanel />`** on `/console` (after login) + **`<BrainDataConsent />`**
  in Settings (states exactly what the AI can/can't access, off by default).
- [x] **Info freshness (through July 2026)** — changelog: new 2.6.0 (July 2026) release
  entry for this work + the $499 confirmation; roadmap quarters advanced (Q2→Q3, Q3→Q4).
  FAQ: added Brain AI data-privacy/consent answer. No fabricated metrics.
- [x] **Docs** — `docs/CUSTOMER-STATUS-AND-BRAIN-CONSENT.md` (architecture + privacy guarantees).

> tsc clean · lint clean (no new warnings) · vitest 770/770 (+33) · build green ·
> dev-smoke-tested: consent defaults off, a status question asks permission, panel mounts,
> changelog shows July 2026. Privacy: own-data-only + fail-closed + nothing to the commercial LLM.
> Note: migration 022 must be pushed to prod (`npx supabase db push`) — env/ops step.

## Active — Close the $499 post-purchase loop (2026-07-04, branch claude/do-everything-ooda-1ijxav) — ✅ MERGED as PR #147

The `success_url` passed `?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` back to `/report/thank-you`, but the
page ignored it — a buyer paid $499 and the app never acknowledged their specific order. Migration
020 had already added an RLS read policy (`auth_users_read_own_report_orders`) that **nothing
consumed**. Both were dangling threads on the revenue-critical path. Closed end-to-end:

- [x] **`lib/reports/order-view.ts`** — pure, sanitizing view builder (mask email, opaque `HS-XXXXXXXX`
  reference, `$499.00` formatting, 14-day report-due date, status→label/step). Zero-mock unit tests (25).
- [x] **`GET /api/reports/order?session_id=`** — unauth, session-id-keyed confirmation. Verifies the
  session is genuinely `paid` with Stripe (instant, webhook-race-proof), enriches from `report_orders`
  if the row landed, returns only the sanitized view. Guards: shape (400), config (503), unknown/unpaid
  (generic 404). 9 tests.
- [x] **`GET /api/reports/orders`** — authenticated list; finally consumes migration 020's RLS policy
  (own rows via `auth.uid()`). 4 tests.
- [x] **`<OrderConfirmation />`** on `/report/thank-you` — reads the real order (reference, amount,
  masked email, report-due date, status). Degrades to `null` when there's no session / lookup fails,
  so the static 14-day timeline always renders.
- [x] **`<MyReportOrders />`** on the signed-in Reports page — renders purchased orders, silent when none.

> tsc clean · lint clean · vitest 710/710 (+38) · build green · dev-server smoke-tested (page 200s,
> endpoints return 400/503/404/200 as designed). No fabricated metrics, Mode-B framing preserved.

## Active — Launch-readiness sweep (2026-06-24, branch dreamy-mcclintock-fc9d8b)

Rebased onto `origin/main` (5d117d5) after discovering main already shipped `ModeBNotice` (#122/#123),
logo-motion-everywhere (#124), and the fabricated-stats-bar removal. Kept only the genuinely-missing fixes:

- [x] **Mode-B disclosure on the homepage** — `ModeBNotice variant="inline"` after the stats strip (CLAUDE.md gate; main covered pricing/security/partners but not home)
- [x] **Mode-B disclosure + CUI-claim honesty on `/brain-ai`** — added `ModeBNotice`; softened metadata "safe for CUI" + card "Local-only, CUI-safe" → Mode-B/C qualifier + hosted-trial caveat
- [x] **Public forbidden colors → tokens** — `partner/layout` avatar `to-purple-500` → steel; `/status` (3) + `/assessment` (1) emerald/amber → `--hs-success`/`--hs-warn`. Public pages now zero forbidden classes.
- [x] **/hipaa PHI over-claim** (advisor catch — Rachel's lead page) — "HIPAA-compliant AI monitoring starting free" softened to "start free; run Mode B for live PHI" + added an inline PHI/BAA boundary note (hosted = non-PHI eval, no BAA).

## Active — Partner-portal channel reframe (2026-06-26, branch HoundShield/frosty-rhodes-841deb)

Resolves the founder-verify flag below. The authed `/partner` portal is a multi-tenant
**reseller/management** surface — that model is exactly what 32 CFR Part 170 / ISO 17020 bar a
C3PAO from doing (refer/resell to a client it assesses). Doctrine channel = RPO/MSP, so the portal
is reframed, not the functionality.

- [x] **Authed `/partner` portal C3PAO → RPO/MSP** — `layout.tsx` (sidebar "RPO / MSP Portal", badge "RPO / MSP Partner", topbar "RPO / MSP Partner Portal" + tokenized the forbidden `emerald-*` badge → `--hs-success`), `page.tsx`, `clients/page.tsx`, `billing/page.tsx`. Product-feature "C3PAO-ready PDF/evidence" mentions left intact (they live outside the authed portal).
- [x] **`/partners` SEO metadata** — title/description/keywords/OG were still pitching "C3PAO partner" / "AI compliance reseller", contradicting the page body's own exclusion note; reframed to RPO/MSP + kept an honest one-line C3PAO-exclusion in the meta description.
- [x] **Dead nav links removed** — sidebar linked to `/partner/team` + `/partner/settings`, which 404 (pages never built). Removed both items (+ now-unused `Users`/`Settings` imports). Building those pages is net-new feature work — flag to founder if wanted, not in this PR.
- [x] **Stale code comments** — `partner-welcome.ts` + `apply/route.ts` called C3PAO "the channel"; corrected to RPO/MSP partner channel.
- [x] **Regression guard** — `app/partner/__tests__/channel-framing.test.ts`: fails the build if any `/c3pao/i` returns to the authed `/partner` tree, asserts RPO/MSP framing present, and asserts the `/partners` metadata never re-pitches a "C3PAO partner" keyword. (This is the in-PR grep gate the lessons file prescribes.)

> tsc clean · vitest 548/548 (+9) · build green · public `/partners` live-verified (title now "RPO & MSP…", exclusion note renders). Authed `/partner` shell unrenderable in dev (pre-existing `supabaseUrl is required`, env-only) — covered by the guard test + prerendered build.

### Review
Minimal additive PR on top of current main. Build green, tests green (539), live-verified. Regulated-data disclosure now on homepage + /brain-ai + /hipaa + (existing) pricing/security/partners/thank-you. Swept all public `page.tsx` for "never leaves your network"/CUI/PHI claims — remaining hits are Mode-B-framed inline or on pages that already carry the notice.

**Founder-verify before public launch (untouched — unverifiable / product decision):**
- `app/about` testimonial "Maria Chen / Vanguard Aero" + history timeline + future "1,000+ Users"; homepage testimonial; per-tier SLA commitments.
- ~~`partner/layout` is branded "C3PAO Partner Portal / Authorized C3PAO"~~ — ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-06-26** (branch `HoundShield/frosty-rhodes-841deb`): authed portal reframed to RPO/MSP; guard test added. Intent did not need confirming — C3PAO referral framing is already on the CLAUDE.md NEVER-DO list (32 CFR Part 170).

**Env-only (founder, per LAUNCH-CHECKLIST):** `database:demo_mode` + `payments:missing_key` — Supabase prod keys, Stripe price IDs + webhook secret, OPENROUTER key (rotate first).

## Superseded by compass correction (history)

## Done — 2026-06-21
- [x] **Lifecycle email system + C3PAO outreach** — Day 14 onboarding finale (PDF report = purchase
  unlock) wired into the drip cron (migration 013 adds `day14_sent_at`); transactional payment-receipt
  + cancellation/win-back emails wired into the Stripe webhook (best-effort, never blocks billing);
  C3PAO partner applicant-confirmation wired into `/api/partners/apply`; full 5-touch C3PAO cold
  outreach sequence in `docs/gtm/c3pao-outreach-sequence.md`. +16 tests, 519/519, build green.
- [x] **Pre-launch hardening sweep** (PR `claude/pre-launch-audit-6iieir`) — GDPR cookie consent
  (PostHog gated on opt-in), `security.txt` (RFC 9116), `/security` Trust page, `/dpa` Data
  Processing Agreement, `/acceptable-use` AUP, `/status` live health page, footer Legal column,
  sitemap entries. Build green, 503/503 tests (+11). Remaining launch blockers are config/keys
  only — see `PRE-LAUNCH-AUDIT-2026-06-21.md`.
